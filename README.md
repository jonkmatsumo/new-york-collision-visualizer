# new-york-collision-visualizer

The following is an interactive data science web application built using the Streamlit library in Python. The results are based on a public dataset on Motor Vehicle Collisions 
from the [City of New York](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95). By navigating through the various menus, one can sort these
collisions by location and date of time - and the results are dynamically generated in real time.
